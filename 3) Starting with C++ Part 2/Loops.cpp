// Loops: In Programming, sometimes there is a need to perform some operation more than once or (say) n number of times. Loops come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

    // Example: Print "Coder Army" five times using for loop.

    for(int i=1; i<=5; i++){
        cout<<"Coder Army!\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
